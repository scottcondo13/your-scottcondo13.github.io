                    It is becoming that time where I should stop leeching off my parents and get a job, and I have some big dreams. I have talked with many people in the workforce who have accumulated experience in some sort of tech related field. My consensus from the accumulation of their recommendations is that I think I want to start smaller. There are several different tiers of tech companies and I don’t think I want to start my journey at the highest point. Microsoft, google, amazon, etc. are quite enticing and would be a lovely capstone to years of hard work, but I want to see the process happen first. I want to work at a smaller company to gain knowledge a spread of different areas. <br/><br/>
Coming into my senior year I honestly didn’t know exactly what point in tech I wanted to pursue. I loved the idea of being an analyst of some kind, but recent endeavors have steered me elsewhere. I am now certain I wish to pursue some form of software engineering. Although, I am at a loss currently without any experience in internships, and Covid-19 wreaking havoc. I have no attachment to where I start my career, rather I just wish to begin accumulating more knowledge. I want to build on the foundation my professors at Wofford college have laid for me.
