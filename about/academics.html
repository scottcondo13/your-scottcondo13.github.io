                    I am currently a senior at Wofford college pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. Throughout my process at wofford college I have had many unique experiences and have dabbled in many different subjects. Although, going into college I knew my passions were in computer science. <br/><br/>
Although my academic career wasnâ€™t just learning subject matter. I was also involved in quite a few extracurricular activities. I came to Wofford on a scholarship for competitive riflery. I have been competing on this team since my first day at wofford. It has made my course load a bit more strenuous due to the fact our sport is both a fall and spring sport. Although, I have strived for achievement in my sport and was the standing captain for the past year and a half. <br/><br/>
In addition to this, I also decided to pursue greek life at Wofford. I joined Pi Kappa Phi my second semester. I have also took strides to help my fraternity in any way I could. My positions in my fraternity have been, Vice President of Zeta chapter sophomore and junior year, and Warden my junior and senior year. I have helped out in many philanthropy events because I am a strong supporter for what our philanthropy stands for. Briefly grazing over that, our philanthropy is The Ability Experience which helps people with mental and physical disabilities. <br/><br/>
Lastly I have been a member of the WoCoders coding team. I attend the practices and help solve our practice problems, but my Rifle competition schedule generally interferes with the dates for coding competitions. <br/><br/>
Overall, my experience at Wofford College has been enlightening, and I have gained many friendships, and some amazing mentors.
