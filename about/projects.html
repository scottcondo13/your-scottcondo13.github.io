                    During my stay at wofford I have done several significant projects. The first that is worthy to talk about is our database project. <br/><br/>
This project was given during the beginning of Covid-19 in the US. We started development during March. We started off in an AWS instance. I worked in a group of 3 members. The language that was used for most of the implementation was Python. We setup a SQL database and communicated with it using Python scripts. Our project focused around Covid-19 information around all 50 states, and some districts. The information was pulled daily from a github repo using a chronjob script. We normalized the data in the database, and began making json functions in order to process specific data we wanted such as the amount of infected in a given county or state FIPS. We also used a deployable flask service in order to have our information go live. We used this along with AJAX to have a consistent stream of accessible data. Unfortunately, the service wasn’t always on because AWS will shutdown an instance after an allotted amount of time, but it was a very enlightening process. <br/><br/>
The next project I have been working on is a java based project. My fellow scrum devs and I have been pulling features for the past 8 weeks trying to finish a digital version of Machi Koro. This experience has been very enlightening. We have been using a lot of interesting tools such as, gradle for a build automation tool, jUnit for unit testing, cucumber for acceptance testing, and jacoco for code coverage. We have been working in increments of 2 week sprints. We have also been utilizing different methods of paired programming. This project has been very helpful to simulate a working environment with a product owner with demands. <br/><br/>
The newest project I will be working on in some weeks to come is a project for character creation in dungeons and dragons. I have been an admirer of this fantasy game for a long time, and my friends have always struggled to make characters on certain websites or the tools just weren’t, so I want to make an intuitive character creator that is not behind a paywall of some kind. I will be using java, gradle and github for this upcoming project!
